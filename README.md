# Chronic Illness Risk Prediction Tool

## Project Intro/Objective

The project aims to design a model that identifies individuals who are at risk of develping chronic illnesses. The model is designed using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifier, and ensemble methods such as Random Forest on a Center for Disease Control survey data with over 400,000 participants. Taking in information about individual's health related behaviors and background information such as race, education and income, the model predicts whether an individual is at risk for a chronic illness. Further, I created a web application that can be used to assess your risk for chronic illnesses.

## Data

I used [The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm) data. BRFSS is a telephone survey conducted by the CDC about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.
The BRFSS is a system of ongoing health-related telephone surveys designed to collect data on health-related
risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, health care access, and use of preventive services from the
adults residing in the United States.

BRFSS collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.
