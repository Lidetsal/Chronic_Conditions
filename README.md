# Chronic Illness Risk Prediction Tool

## Project Intro/Objective

The project aims to identify individual's risk of chronic illnesses using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes classifier, and ensemble methods such as Random Forest with a Center for Disease Control survey data with over 400,000 participants. Taking in information about individual's health related behaviors and background information such as race, education and income, the model predicts whether individual's are at risk for a chronic illness.



## Methods Used

Machine Learning - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Clustering

## Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter
- sklearn
- Plotly
- Matplot

## Data

I used The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. BRFSS is a telephone survey conducted by the CDC about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.
The BRFSS is a system of ongoing health-related telephone surveys designed to collect data on health-related
risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, health care access, and use of preventive services from the
adults residing in the United States.

BRFSS collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.

# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create an automated tool that can classify whether an individual is at risk for a chronic illness and identify the top risk factors.
